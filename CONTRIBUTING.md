# Contributing

Before contributing ensure that you've reviewed the current project, including the styling by the root .vscode configured clang-format and JS formatting.

## Adding Features and Fixes

If you would like to contribute code, please open an issue and we can discuss changes and approach.

## Branching and Merging

When starting work, please begin a new branch, with an appropriate name pertaining to the issue (`feature/GH-123` for example). Feel free to provide as many commits during the development process, but once a request is approved, please rebase and squash your commit with a formatted message according to the conventional commits styling: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/
